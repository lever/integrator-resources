## Data API Postman

**A Postman collection to get ramped up with the Data API quickly.**

## OAuth Example App

**A small app to experience and see code examples of the 5 steps to get OAuth authentication set up on your integration**

To get started with the example app

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the folder

```
npm install
npx nodemon backend.js
```

2. Make sure you've registered for OAuth, and added a localhost URI to your list of callbacks. Adding http://localhost:3000/login would be the easiest!

3. Add at least one opportunity to your Lever Sandbox account

4. Add your credentials to .env file

5. Open http://localhost:3000

6. Click CONNECT TO LEVER

7. Log into your Lever Sandbox account

8. Click Accept to grant your app access to the scopes requested

9. Click Opportunities (Make sure to change the endpoint if you have not requested either of the opportunities scopes)
